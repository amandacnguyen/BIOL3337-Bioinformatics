# BIOL 3337: Bioinformatics
## Repository Overview
This repository contains projects and analyses completed for BIOL 3337: Bioinformatics (Spring 2025) at The University of Texas at Dallas, under the instruction of Dr. Tian Hong.

The collection demonstrates proficiency in bioinformatics methods and computational approaches to biological data, including:

- Sequence alignment and analysis of nucleotide/amino acid data
- Biological database querying and data extraction (PDB, UniProt, NCBI)
- Statistical analysis of genomic and proteomic datasets
- Multiple sequence alignment interpretation and visualization
- Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary relationship inference

## Repository Status
This portfolio is currently a work in progress (as of April 2025). I am actively refining the code organization, improving documentation, and enhancing visualizations. While the core functionality and analyses from course assignments are complete, I am developing these materials into more comprehensive project demonstrations. Check back regularly for updates!

### Current Development Focus:
- Refactoring code into more modular, object-oriented structure
- Enhancing documentation with detailed explanations and usage examples
- Creating additional visualizations for clearer result interpretation
- Consolidating related assignments into cohesive project workflows

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Implementation of bioinformatics algorithms and tools
- Data processing and manipulation with BioPython
- Visualization of biological sequence data
- Pattern recognition in biological sequences
- Integration of computational approaches with biological interpretation

## Applications
The projects in this repository apply computational methods to address fundamental questions in molecular biology, genetics, and evolution, demonstrating the intersection of computer science and biological research.

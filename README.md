# BIOL 3337: Bioinformatics
## Repository Overview
This repository contains projects and analyses completed for BIOL 3337: Bioinformatics (Spring 2025) at The University of Texas at Dallas, under the instruction of Dr. Tian Hong.

The collection demonstrates proficiency in bioinformatics methods and computational approaches to biological data, including:

- Sequence alignment and analysis of nucleotide/amino acid data
- Biological database querying and data extraction (PDB, UniProt, NCBI)
- Statistical analysis of genomic and proteomic datasets
- Multiple sequence alignment interpretation and visualization
- Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary relationship inference

## Repository Status
This repository contains ongoing work for BIOL 3337: Bioinformatics (Spring 2025) at The University of Texas at Dallas. As I am currently enrolled in this course, the materials represent incomplete assignments and projects that are being actively developed throughout the semester. This repository serves as both a workspace for current coursework and will eventually become a complete portfolio of my bioinformatics skills.

### Current Development Focus:
- Completing ongoing course assignments and projects
- Implementing bioinformatics algorithms as introduced in the course curriculum
- Building proficiency with BioPython and other bioinformatics tools
- Organizing code and documentation for both academic submission and portfolio purposes
- Creating visualizations to effectively communicate biological data analysis

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Implementation of bioinformatics algorithms and tools
- Data processing and manipulation with BioPython
- Visualization of biological sequence data
- Pattern recognition in biological sequences
- Integration of computational approaches with biological interpretation

## Applications
The projects in this repository apply computational methods to address fundamental questions in molecular biology, genetics, and evolution, demonstrating the intersection of computer science and biological research.
